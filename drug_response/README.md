Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for mutational data for 100 cell lines
and corresponding drug responses (lnIC50).

An initial PCA with cell classification is shown in Figure 2. 
An xg boosting algorithm is used to identify the most important 
mutated genes for drug response (Figure 3). An second multinomial 
classifier is trained using a gene subset with performance of the 
training set (Figure 4) and test dataset (Figure 5).
